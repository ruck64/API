# API

This project creates a web page that pulls information from an API. The API contains a list of students and information about that student such as grade for a class and house. This breaks the GPA of these students into categories labeled on the mainpage. These are all the students, all the freshman students, all the students that reside in the Gryffindor house, and all the students taking astronomy.
